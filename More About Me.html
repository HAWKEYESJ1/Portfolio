            <h4>
      I first got into programming through game modding, and it all started with Minecraft. I remember how exciting it was to figure out how to change the way the game looked and worked. The first thing I modded was the villagers, I turned them into knights who defended their village from enemies. I also gave the iron golems a new look, turning them into heavily armored knights with shields. Snow golems became archers fighting alongside the villagers. On the enemy side, I made zombies into evil knights, skeletons into enemy archers, and spiders into horses that enemy can ride. It felt like I had created my own medieval battle inside Minecraft. That experience made me realize how powerful and fun coding could be.
            </h4>
             <h4>
        As I got older, I was introduced to software development by my cousin, who taught me the basics of web development. He told me that web development is much easier than game development and still pays well. That’s when I started focusing more on learning to build website and app, and I that when I start to slowly losing interest in game modding.
             </h4>
            <h4>
        Now, I’m working hard to become a professional software developer. I’m also interested in cybersecurity because I believe it’s an important skill to have, especially with AI becoming more powerful. If AI takes over some jobs, I want to make sure I still have place to work in the future tech.
